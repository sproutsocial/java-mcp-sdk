/**
 * The core building block providing the server-side MCP transport for Streamable HTTP
 * servers. Implement this interface to bridge between a particular server-side technology
 * and the MCP server transport layer.
 *
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of the provider dictates that it be created first, upon application
 * startup, and then passed into either
 * {@link io.modelcontextprotocol.server.McpServer#sync(McpStreamableServerTransportProvider)}
 * or
 * {@link io.modelcontextprotocol.server.McpServer#async(McpStreamableServerTransportProvider)}.
 * As a result of the MCP server creation, the provider will be notified of a
 * {@link McpStreamableServerSession.Factory} which will be used to handle a 1:1
 * communication between a newly connected client and the server using a session concept.
 * The provider's responsibility is to create instances of
 * {@link McpStreamableServerTransport} that the session will utilise during the session
 * lifetime.
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally, the {@link McpStreamableServerTransport}s can be closed in bulk when
 * {@link #close()} or {@link #closeGracefully()} are called as part of the normal
 * application shutdown event. Individual {@link McpStreamableServerTransport}s can also
 * be closed on a per-session basis, where the {@link McpServerSession#close()} or
 * {@link McpServerSession#closeGracefully()} closes the provided transport.
